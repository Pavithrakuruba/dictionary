# Q36.Write a Python program to match key values in two dictionaries.
# Sample dictionary: {'key1': 1, 'key2': 3, 'key3': 2}, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}
# Expected output: key1: 1 is present in both x and y


# a={'key1':1,'key2':3,'key3':2}
# b={'key1':1,'key2':2}
# for i in a:
#     for j in b:
#         if i==j and a[i]==b[j]:
#             print(i,":",a[i]," is present in both x and y")
